      "page_content='Chapter 3\\n\\'There are three stages in your reintegration,\\' said O\\'Brien. \\'There is learning, there is understanding, and there is acceptance. It is time for you to enter upon the second stage.\\'\\nAs always, Winston was lying flat on his back. But of late his bonds were looser. They still held him to the bed, but he could move his knees a little and could turn his head from side to side and raise his arms from the elbow. The dial, also, had grown to be less of a terror. He could evade its pangs if he was quick-witted enough: it was chiefly when he showed stupidity that O\\'Brien pulled the lever. Sometimes they got through a whole session without use of the dial. He could not remember how many sessions there had been. The whole process seemed to stretch out over a long, indefinite time--weeks, possibly--and the intervals between the sessions might sometimes have been days, sometimes only an hour or two.\\n\\'As you lie there,\\' said O\\'Brien, \\'you have often wondered--you have even asked me--why the Ministry of Love should expend so much time and trouble on you. And when you were free you were puzzled by what was essentially the same question. You could grasp the mechanics of the Society you lived in, but not its underlying motives. Do you remember writing in your diary, \"I understand HOW: I do not understand WHY\"? It was when you thought about \"why\" that you doubted your own sanity. You have read THE BOOK, Goldstein\\'s book, or parts of it, at least. Did it tell you anything that you did not know already?\\'\\n\\'You have read it?\\' said Winston.\\n\\'I wrote it. That is to say, I collaborated in writing it. No book is produced individually, as you know.\\'\\n\\'Is it true, what it says?\\'\\n\\'As description, yes. The programme it sets forth is nonsense. The secret accumulation of knowledge--a gradual spread of enlightenment--ultimately a proletarian rebellion--the overthrow of the Party. You foresaw yourself that that was what it would say. It is all nonsense. The proletarians will never revolt, not in a thousand years or a million. They cannot. I do not have to tell you the reason: you know it already. If you have ever cherished any dreams of violent insurrection, you must abandon them. There is no way in which the Party can be overthrown. The rule of the Party is for ever. Make that the starting-point of your thoughts.\\'' metadata={'source': './files/document.txt'}\n"
